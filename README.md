# Adaptive CDN Simulation

This project simulates an adaptive Content Delivery Network (CDN) with various caching strategies and routing algorithms. It is designed for educational and research purposes, particularly in the field of Computer Networks.

## Features

- Adaptive CDN simulation
- Multiple caching strategies
- Customizable routing algorithms
- Data generation and performance metrics

## Project Structure

- `adaptive_cdn_sim.py` - Main simulation script for adaptive CDN.
- `caching_stratergy.py` - Implements different caching strategies.
- `CDN.py` - Core CDN logic and classes.
- `cn.py` - Additional network logic.
- `data_generation.py` - Scripts for generating initial data.
- `Data_Main.py` - Main data handling script.
- `initial_content_data.json` - Sample content data.
- `main_simulation.py` - Entry point for running simulations.
- `performance_matrix.py` - Performance evaluation and metrics.
- `Routing_algorithm.py` - Routing algorithm implementations.
- `table.py` - Data table utilities.
- `Tasks.txt` - Project tasks and notes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install Python 3.x.
3. Install any required dependencies (see below).
4. Run the main simulation script:
   ```powershell
   python main_simulation.py
   ```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- (List any additional Python packages if used, e.g., numpy, pandas)

## Usage

Modify the simulation parameters in the respective Python files as needed. Run the scripts to simulate different CDN scenarios and analyze the results.
