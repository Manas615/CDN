Okay, given the presentation and your goal of creating a *simulation* of an Adaptive Social Media Content Delivery Network, here's a breakdown of how you can achieve this, focusing on the practical steps and tools you can use.

## 1. Environment Setup

*   **Programming Language:** Python is an excellent choice due to its extensive libraries for networking, simulation, data analysis, and visualization.
*   **Simulation Framework:** Consider using a network simulation framework like:
    *   **ns-3:**  A discrete-event network simulator, popular in research.  Steeper learning curve but highly configurable.  (C++ based, but Python bindings are available)
    *   **Mininet:**  Creates a software-defined network (SDN) on your machine (or a VM). Easier to set up and use than ns-3, great for prototyping.
    *   **Custom Simulation:** If the complexity of ns-3 is too high and Mininet doesn't quite fit, you can build a simplified simulation using Python libraries like `networkx` for network topology and `simpy` for discrete event simulation.  This gives you the most control but requires more coding.
*   **Libraries:**
    *   `networkx`:  For creating and manipulating network graphs.
    *   `simpy`: For discrete event simulation.
    *   `numpy`: For numerical computations and data analysis.
    *   `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
    *   `matplotlib` or `seaborn`: For data visualization.
    *   `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models (if you want to predict content virality).

## 2. Data Generation (Simulate Network Conditions and User Engagement)

This is crucial as you're creating a simulated environment.

*   **Network Conditions:**
    *   **Latency:** Model network latency (delay) between different nodes in your CDN. You can use random distributions (e.g., normal distribution) with varying means and standard deviations to simulate different network conditions.  Consider simulating congestion.
    *   **Bandwidth:** Assign bandwidth limits to the links between nodes.
    *   **Packet Loss:** Introduce random packet loss to simulate unreliable network connections.
*   **User Engagement Patterns:**
    *   **Content Requests:** Simulate users requesting content from different geographic locations.  Model the rate of requests (e.g., Poisson process).
    *   **Engagement Scores:** Assign "engagement scores" to content.  This could be based on likes, shares, comments, or view duration. Model how these scores change over time, especially for potentially viral content.  Consider simulating different user "interests" and how they affect engagement.
    *   **Content Popularity:** Simulate how content becomes popular over time. Some content might start slowly and then go viral. Others may have a burst of popularity and then fade quickly.

Here's a simple Python example using `numpy` to simulate latency:

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate latency between two nodes (in milliseconds)
mean_latency = 50  # Average latency
std_dev_latency = 10 # Standard deviation
num_samples = 100

latencies = np.random.normal(mean_latency, std_dev_latency, num_samples)
latencies = np.abs(latencies) # Ensure latency is not negative

print(latencies)
```

## 3. Routing Algorithm (Engagement-Aware)

*   **Weighted Decision-Making:** Implement a routing algorithm that considers both network latency *and* content engagement scores.
    *   **Traditional Routing:** Start with a basic routing algorithm like shortest path (Dijkstra's algorithm) based on latency.
    *   **Engagement-Aware Modification:**  Modify the algorithm to give preference to paths that lead to servers with cached content that has high engagement scores.  You'll need to define a weighting function that combines latency and engagement.
    *   **Example:**

    ```
    Path_Cost =  Latency_Weight * Latency + (1 - Latency_Weight) * (1 / Engagement_Score)
    ```

    Where `Latency_Weight` is a value between 0 and 1, allowing you to control the relative importance of latency and engagement.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Make the `Latency_Weight` adjustable based on overall network conditions.  If the network is congested, prioritize latency. If the network is relatively uncongested, prioritize engagement.

## 4. Caching Strategy (LFU-Based with Viral Content Prioritization)

*   **LFU (Least Frequently Used):** Implement a basic LFU caching algorithm.  This means that the least frequently requested content is evicted from the cache when space is needed.
*   **Viral Content Prioritization:** Modify the LFU algorithm to prioritize caching potentially viral content.
    *   **Prediction:** Use a simple threshold-based approach.  If content's engagement score exceeds a certain threshold within a specific time window, mark it as "potentially viral" and give it higher priority in the cache.  For more advanced prediction, explore using a simple machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression) trained on historical engagement data.
    *   **Cache Replacement:** When the cache is full and new content needs to be cached, evict the least frequently used content *unless* it's marked as potentially viral.

## 5. Performance Metrics

*   **Server Usage:** Track the CPU and memory utilization of each simulated server.
*   **Cache Hit Rates:**  Measure the percentage of content requests that are served from the cache.  Higher cache hit rates mean better performance.
*   **Content Delivery Times:**  Measure the time it takes to deliver content to users. This is a key performance indicator (KPI).
*   **Engagement Score Served:** Average engagement score of content served
*   **Cost:** You can assign a cost to each network link to determine how much it costs to serve requests
*   **Network Congestion:** How many network requests are timing out

## 6. Visualization

*   **Real-time Graphs:** Create visualizations to monitor the performance of your simulated CDN.
    *   **Latency:** Plot the average latency over time.
    *   **Cache Hit Rate:** Plot the cache hit rate over time.
    *   **Server Load:** Show the CPU and memory utilization of each server.
    *   **Content Popularity:** Visualize the engagement scores of different content items.
*   **Tools:**
    *   `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are excellent choices for creating static plots.
    *   For more interactive visualizations, consider using libraries like `plotly` or `bokeh`.

## 7. Optimize for Resource-Constrained Environments (Edge Computing)

*   **Limited Resources:** Simulate edge servers with limited CPU, memory, and storage capacity.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Implement strategies for allocating resources to different content items based on their popularity and engagement scores.
*   **Edge Caching:** Focus on optimizing caching strategies for edge servers with limited storage.
